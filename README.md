# üì¶ MLOps Project K64 ‚Äì Bank Term Deposit Prediction

Welcome to the **MLOps Project K64** repository! This project implements a full MLOps pipeline to predict whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit, using the **Bank Marketing Dataset**.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project applies MLOps principles to the entire machine learning lifecycle, including:

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Model training, validation, and testing
- Model registry
- Streamlit interface for prediction
- MongoDB integration for test data storage

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10**
- **scikit-learn**
- **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- **MLflow** ‚Äì for model tracking and registry
- **Streamlit** ‚Äì for interactive user input and inference
- **MongoDB** ‚Äì for storing new test input data
- **n8n** ‚Äì optional future automation (e.g., retraining trigger)

### üîç Source

- Created by: S√©rgio Moro, Paulo Cortez, and Paulo Rita (2014)  
- Original UCI Repository: [Bank Marketing Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)

### üìå Dataset Variants

- `bank-additional-full.csv`: Full dataset (41,188 instances)
- `bank-additional.csv`: 10% subset (4,119 instances), suitable for computationally intensive models

### üß† Prediction Task

- **Goal**: Predict if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (target: `y`, values: `yes` or `no`)

## Model Card
The model was deployed to the web using the FastAPI package and API tests were created. The API tests will be embedded in a CI/CD framework using GitHub Actions. After we built our API locally and tested it, we deployed it to Render and tested it again live. Weights and Biases were used to manage and track all artifacts.

So, in general, the notebooks used were divided into 7 parts:

1. The search for data
2. Exploratory analysis
3. Pre-Processing
4. Tests
5. Splitting the data between training and testing.
6. Training
7. Test
